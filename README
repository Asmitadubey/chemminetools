ChemMine Tools: an Open Source Web Framework for Small Molecule Analysis

Look at bootstrap.sh for software dependencies and installation
instructions.

To get started with a development box:

1) Download and install Vagrant and Virtualbox from here:
    http://www.vagrantup.com
    https://www.virtualbox.org
2) Clone this repo and cd into it:
    git clone https://github.com/TylerBackman/chemminetools.git
    cd chemminetools
3) Run this command to provision and launch your devel environment: 
    vagrant up
4) Log in and start celery manually as this isn't working for some reason:
    vagrant ssh
    sudo /etc/init.d/celeryd start
    exit
5) You will now have a running chemmine tools at:
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/myCompounds/addCompounds/
6) Note that this server is very insecure, as the private keys and passwords
come from the example file. You should block it with a firewall until you secure it
for production! Also, note that some tools (such as EI search) require large
databases and won't work with an out of the box devel container.
7) Shut down vagrant (re-run 'vagrant up' to relaunch):
    vagrant halt
