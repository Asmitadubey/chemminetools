ChemMine Tools: an Open Source Framework for Chemical Genomics

This repository represents the codebase for the new Django based rewrite of ChemMine Tools.

Look at bootstrap.sh for software dependencies and installation
instructions. These instructions are automated, to use them do this:

To get started with a development box:
1) Install Vagrant and Virtualbox
2) Clone this repo and cd into it
3) Run this command to provision and launch your devel environment 
    vagrant up
4) You will now have a running chemmine tools at http://127.0.0.1:8080
As the CMS isn't setup, try browsing to http://127.0.0.1:8080/myCompounds
5) Log in and start celery manually as this isn't working for some reason:
    sudo bash
    /etc/init.d/celeryd start
6) Note that this server is very insecure, as the private keys and passwords
come from the example file. You should block it with a firewall until you secure it
for production! Also, note that some tools (such as EI search) require large
databases and won't work with an out of the box devel container.
