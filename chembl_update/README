eiR version >= 1.29.1 is required.

1) Download new ChEMBL db file and load into PostgreSQL
	./update_chembl.sh <chembl version number> 
1a)after this runs, the old database will be left as "chembl_old", you should drop this database when done with the whole update

2) Generate eiR index
2a) create the loading database:
	CREATE DATABASE eisearch_chembl_loading owner=ei_updater;
2b) run: update_eiR.R
	This will pull all the SDF definitions out of the chembl database loaded in step 1
	and then build an eiR index on it. Building the index will require at least 8GB of 
	RAM, so the VM type may need to be modified before running this.
	Index files will be created in /srv/shared_jobs/development/eir_index/data

2c) Copy index files into place. This step will break the live ei search until step 2d is also complete.
	cp -a /srv/shared_jobs/development/eir_index/data/ to /srv/shared_jobs/production/eir_index/
2d) in postgresql, run:
	ALTER DATABASE eisearch_chembl RENAME TO eisearch_chembl_old;
	ALTER DATABASE eisearch_chembl_loading RENAME TO eisearch_chembl;

2e) when all is working:
	DROP DATABASE eisearch_chembl_old;
